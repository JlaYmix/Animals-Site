    <p>Indian dog breeds are unique and have a special place in the hearts of dog lovers. These dogs are not only loyal and affectionate but also make great companions and protectors. However, there are around 80 million homeless cats and dogs in India who need assistance, care, and a place to call home.</p>
    <p>At <b>Stray Animal Foundation of India (SAFI)</b>, we are focused on helping stray animals in India receive the care and support they need. We work tirelessly to restore compassion to India’s relationship with its stray animals and ease the strain on the country’s overburdened shelter network. We do this in many different ways, including providing funding, shelter infrastructure, organizational support, vet care, supplies, guidance, resources, education, manpower, and more.</p>
    <p>We rely on charitable contributions to continue the crucial work that we do, and 100% of contributions are deployed in the field. These donations directly affect the number of strays we are able to rescue, treat, and shelter. You can help us make a difference in the lives of India’s animals by donating to our cause today!</p>
